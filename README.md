## 🔹 Project Overview

This **AI-powered classroom augmentation platform** reimagines education with virtual tutors, interview agents, and project advisors. It enables students to acquire **future-ready IT skills**, prepares them for **industry-aligned career paths**, and promotes **hands-on learning** beyond rote memorization.  

Students can interact with AI agents to get:  
- Personalized learning paths & skill gap analysis  
- Weekly AI-powered mock interviews with scoring  
- Project guidance and portfolio generation  
- IT job role simulations and business-oriented career insights  

The platform leverages **multi-agent AI orchestration** (Owl, Manus, GenZ Spark, ByteBotOS, WarmwindOS) with a **Small Language Model (SLM)** for natural language understanding, guidance, and automated pseudo-code generation.
